		<p>I have made a few things!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://volumes.hvii.cc/">Volumes</a> and
				<a href="https://crabble.hvii.cc"> Crabble</a>
				are word games. Volumes features a daily puzzle that consists on finding the missing words between
				unrelated sentences. In Crabble, you unshuffle strings of words. I plan to merge them sometime!
				(On GitHub:
				<a href="https://github.com/hs7t/volumes">Volumes</a>,
				<a href="https://github.com/hs7t/crabble">Crabble</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://cubby.website/">cubby.website</a> is a directory of personal websites where
				every website gets a point on a map. Paradoxically, my website is not there - I plan on
				adding it soon! (<a href="https://github.com/hs7t/cubby">GitHub</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://very.really.insanely.extremely.long.cool.link.hvii.cc/">screamify</a>
				is a silly little static website that encodes URLs into scream-like strings that it can then
				decode and use for redirects. (<a href="https://github.com/hs7t/screamify">GitHub</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/hs7t/peek">peek</a> is a CLI tool that quickly gives you a
				preview of all human-readable text files in a directory. (<a

				>)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I'm currently starting a ton of projects thanks to
			<a href="https://siege.hackclub.com/">Siege</a>, a Hack Club program. I'll get around to
			better mantaining them soon, I swear!
