It all crumbles into fine soft sands; <br>
As the breeze thickens and sweeps me past <br>
Good things wither when they grace my hands.


I try to thread careful through time's vast lands, <br>
Yet as much as I count each blessing I'm cast, <br>
It all crumbles into fine soft sands. <br>


The voices of guides and beloved friends <br>
Ring loudly and clearly before fading fast; <br>
Good things wither when they grace my hands.


Though I wish I could weave each of these strands <br>
Into a colourful fabric of life I've passed, <br>
It all crumbles into fine soft sands.


And when I tire of the tides’ demands <br>
I look behind to an horizon hazed, not glassed; <br>
Good things wither when they grace my hands.


Far enough, when the storm lands, <br>
the dust will find me to settle at last. <br>
It all crumbles into fine soft sands; <br>
Good things wither when they grace my hands.
