	<div class="paragraph-block">
		<p>
			You can call me Ali. I have been here on Earth for some
			{moment().diff(birthDate, 'days')} days (or
			{moment().diff(birthDate, 'years')} years). I was born in
			<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1320707">Cali, VAC, Colombia</a>, and
			currently live in a small town nearby.
		</p>
		<p>
			Making things makes me happy. Although I’m not particularly good at anything, I enjoy words,
			design, and fiddling with computers.
